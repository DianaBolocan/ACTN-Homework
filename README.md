# Computational Number Theory-Homework
Computational Number Theory Homework:
  - Homework 1: Implement Reed-Solomon encoding/decoding using the algorithms discussed in class. For simplicity, consider s = 1 (a single error may be corrected). Use as few modular inversions operations as possible.
  - Homework 2: Implement multi-prime RSA decryption using the Chinese remainder theorem algorithm discussed in class. Implement multi-power RSA decryption using the Chinese remainder theorem algorithm and Henselâ€™s lifting lemma discussed in class.
  - Homework 3: Implement the Solovay-Strassen primality test. Implement the Lucas-Lehmer primality test for Mersenne numbers.
  - TBA
